# wealth
``wealth`` is an example of a user-friendly rich wrapper.

It's not expected to follow the UNIX philosophy. If you're one of the two people
who are familiar with my other projects, ``wealth``'s relationship to ``rich`` is
the same as ``shovel``'s to ``tunnel``.

## Status
wealth is not in a usable state but is (probably) in development.

## Dependencies
- rich
- Go
- A shell that is at least somewhat POSIX-compliant
- whiptail
- fzf
